# Platzi Community Wrapper Eraser Extension

![PCWEE_Logo](images/pcwee128.png)

The idea of this project is to remove the Community section on the Platzi's courses.

## Why?

Reading and hearing feedback from different users, there are people who likes the community section,
although, there are people who don't. So that's why I did the project, to fulfill both users, if you
like the community section, just don't download it, but if you don't like, go ahead and use it.

## TODOs

- [ ] Add a selectable state.
- [ ] Add a background service that removes the *community wrapper* automatically.
